	GETTING GITHUB TO STOP BEING A BUTT   ✧˖٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و ♡
		(a fae bramblepelt tutorial compilation)
This ssh-github-key tutorial worked on my MacOS (Monterey, 12.5 – M2 chip). I have not thoroughly tested or debugged it. This assumes you already have a bash profile on your computer, as well as a github account and a github repository you’d like to link to a local repository.
GitHub de-authorized password-based authentication so now we need to use something different – I used ‘ssh’ in this tutorial. As of Feb 6th, 2025, it worked. Huzzah.

-	Part 0 – Installing “gh”

Follow tutorial up until “Authentication”. I used Homebrew to install gh.

-	Part 1 – Generating an ssh key (local)

Follow complete tutorial.

-	Part 2 – Adding an ssh key to your account.

Follow complete tutorial.

-	Part 3 – Connecting a github repository to a local copy.
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository
 Starting from….

Cloning a repository
1.	On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2.	Above the list of files, click 
3.	…..
4.	•  Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
•  Press Enter to create your local clone.
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `Spoon-Knife`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.

…. Then move to…

	--- STEP 4 – Commiting your adds

	.Starting from…

Test the SSH key:
ssh -T git@github.com
Change directory into the local clone of your repository (if you're not already there) and run:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/your-repository.git
If the repo is under an organization the command is slightly different:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:organization/your-repo.git
Now try editing a file (try the README) and then do:
git add -A
git commit -am "Update README.md"
git push
Add the key to the ssh-agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
You should not be asked for a username or password. If it works, your SSH key is correctly configured.

	I pushed my local changes to the repository to the directory to confirm it works. Yay!
